# Hazard-Detection-System

Hazard Detection System is an advanced artificial intelligence–based project designed to identify and alert drivers about potential road hazards in real time. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, especially the YOLOv5 model, this system can detect various objects like cars, trucks, potholes, pedestrians, bicycles, and motorbikes from live video feeds or recorded footage. When any potential danger is detected, the system immediately provides both visual and audio alerts to ensure the driver’s safety and prevent accidents.

This project combines technologies such as Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, and Tkinter to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. It can work with a webcam or uploaded video files, making it flexible for real-world use. The system also keeps a record of detected hazards with timestamps and can capture snapshots for later review. Overall, the Hazard Detection System offers an efficient, automated, and intelligent approach to improving road safety through real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms.

Real-Time Detection:
Detects road hazards such as potholes, vehicles, pedestrians, and motorbikes in live video streams using YOLOv5.

Instant Alerts:
Provides audio (voice or alarm) and visual warnings whenever a hazard is detected to ensure quick driver response.

Smart Interface:
Built with Tkinter GUI, allowing users to easily choose between webcam mode and video file input.

Data Logging:
Automatically stores detected hazards with timestamps in a CSV file for record-keeping and analysis.

Snapshot Feature:
Users can capture screenshots of detected hazards during video processing for later verification.

Multi-Technology Integration:
Combines Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, Pygame, and pyttsx3 for detection, visualization, and alert generation.

Improved Road Safety:
Helps in reducing accidents by continuously monitoring the environment and providing early hazard warnings.

User-Friendly & Scalable:
Easy to use, can be enhanced for integration with self-driving cars or smart traffic systems in the future.
